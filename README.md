# Simple Angular Starter Template
This is a simple Angular website utilizing Server Side Rendering (SSR) and Angular Material out of the box. It's nothing much, just a simple way to start with angular universal.
As a bonus it contains most common (in my opinion) util methods aimed to ramp up your development speed.

## Dependencies
- You must have `node` and `npm` installed (via `brew install node` or [NodeJS.org](https://nodejs.org/en/));
- You must also have `typings` installed globally via `npm i -g typings`
- Be sure that you have `typings` version `1.x`

## Getting Started


```bash
git clone https://github.com/ArtemWolynski/AngularWebsiteTemplate
cd ngWebsiteTemplate
npm i
typings install
npm start
```

Then navigate your browser to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) and use the app.
